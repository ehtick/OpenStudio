# We cannot make the libs that make up the shared library public dependency at all, if we do
# then we have to export and install them as well, which we probably don't want to do.

# If we try to include directories from the dependent libraries directly, we have to use
# generator expressions to get the specific configuration's INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES

# This also does not seem to do what we ultimately want, as it would also require
# that we export the .a files.

# So here we are, I'm manually exporting the directories, it's probably a mistake
# TODO reevaluate this.
